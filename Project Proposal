Matthew Keiser Data Science Project

Using data from the American Community Survey, I would like to find what demographic and social features are strong indicators of entrepreneurship and how these indicators change when controlling for demographic features. I will attempt to find features in the data that correlate with Self-Employment Income (one of the dataset features) and develop a model to predict whether or not a person is self-employed (a non-zero Self-Employment Income). I would also like to extend the analysis by seeing how the model and predicitive power change when controling for demographic features (Race, Gender, Education, etc.)

I will be using data from the American Community Survey (https://www.kaggle.com/c/2013-american-community-survey/data and https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html). This is a publically available dataset created by the Census Bureau.

I chose this topic because I have considered self employment personally, and want to understand what forces affect a person's propensity for entrepreneurship.
